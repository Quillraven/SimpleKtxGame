# Welcome to A Simple Ktx Game

This is a tutorial based on the [A Simple Game](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/A-simple-game) game from the original LibGDX wiki.
The idea is to demonstrate a small example of how that game could look like in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) using [LibKTX](https://github.com/libktx) which contains Kotlin extensions for LibGDX games and applications.

It should give you a good starting point for developing your own games in the future using LibGDX and Kotlin.

The tutorial **will not** explain LibGDX or Kotlin basics.
